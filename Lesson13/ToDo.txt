(also check list in Lesson13.doc)

- add delete database entry capability (for programs and timings)
- add modify database data capability

- add capability to enter multiple numeric entries on one input line
    - problem sizes for generating timings for a program
    - progrma #'s for plotting multiple program timings on a single plot

- add capability to enter multiple different program #'s (to plot timings for on a single plot)

- more error checking on command line parameters
- more error checking inside c/python code
- experiment what happens when C numerical code explodes (e.g. n too large or too small)

- when entering program info (program name, description, command line prefix), prompt with entered info
  to verify correctness
- GUI menuing system

- l2vecnorm: check for non-positive vector size
- improve architecture of C programs

- do Fortan versions of C numerical routines
- do matrix multiplication alternatives in C (programs and array notation vs pointer method)
